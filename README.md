# Job-Analytics- 
In this project, the objective is to perform web scraping using Python to extract more than 300 job listings related to Python roles from the Instahyre website. The extracted data will be structured into a dataset ('jobs') with specific details for each job listing, including job title, location, company founding year, number of employees, company description, required skills, and a link to the job listing for further details or application.

Key considerations include adhering to ethical scraping practices, respecting the website's terms of service, and maintaining proper web scraping etiquette to avoid overloading the servers. The Python script used for scraping will be well-documented with comments to explain each step of the process, ensuring readability and clarity. The final dataset will be organized using the pandas library or appropriate file handling methods, formatted with headers and ready for submission in CSV or other specified formats.

This project aims to enhance skills in web scraping, data extraction, and dataset organization, providing practical experience in handling structured data from web pages for real-world applications in data analytics and automation.
